# PRODIGY-DS-04
In this project, I utilized Python and several of its powerful libraries, such as Pandas, NLTK, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn, to perform a comprehensive sentiment analysis. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the steps involved:

Data Collection :
I gathered social media data from various platforms using APIs and web scraping techniques.
Data Preprocessing :
Cleaned the data by removing noise such as URLs, mentions, hashtags, and punctuations.
Tokenized the text and performed lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.
Sentiment Analysis :
Used NLTK's VADER sentiment analyzer to classify the sentiment of each post as positive, negative, or neutral.
Calculated sentiment scores to quantify the intensity of sentiment expressed in the posts.
Data Visualization :
Visualized the distribution of sentiments across different topics or brands using bar plots and pie charts.
Created word clouds to highlight the most frequently mentioned words and phrases in positive and negative posts.
Analyzed sentiment trends over time to observe changes in public opinion
